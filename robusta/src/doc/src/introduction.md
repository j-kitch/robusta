# Introduction

**Robusta** is an implementation of a Java 8 Virtual Machine, following
[the specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/index.html)
as a personal project.

Given the scale of a Java Virtual Machine, I'm documenting the project in this 
book in order to keep track of progress.
